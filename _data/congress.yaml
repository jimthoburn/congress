      <p>"Perhaps most troubling, today’s executive order – issued on Holocaust Remembrance Day, no less – recalls a dark episode in American history. Just over 75 years ago, a ship called the St. Louis, carrying nearly a thousand Jews fleeing Nazi Germany, sailed so close to the United States that passengers could see the lights of Miami. But rather than welcome these refugees, America turned them away. Many of these Jewish refugees were killed by the Nazis when they were forced to return to Europe. Making sure that such a tragedy never happens again became the bedrock of U.S. and international refugee and asylum law and policy. Mr. Trump’s actions today upend this foundational principle and endanger millions all over the world.”</p>&mdash; Statement

      <p>"In light of attempts by jihadist groups to infiltrate fighters into refugee flows to the West, along with Europe’s tragic experience coping with this problem, the Trump Administration’s executive order on refugees is a common-sense security measure to prevent terror attacks on the homeland. While accommodations should be made for green card holders and those who’ve assisted the U.S. armed forces, this is a useful temporary measure on seven nations of concern until we can verify who is entering the United States.” </p>&mdash; Statement

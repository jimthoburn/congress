      <p>"Perhaps most troubling, today’s executive order – issued on Holocaust Remembrance Day, no less – recalls a dark episode in American history. Just over 75 years ago, a ship called the St. Louis, carrying nearly a thousand Jews fleeing Nazi Germany, sailed so close to the United States that passengers could see the lights of Miami. But rather than welcome these refugees, America turned them away. Many of these Jewish refugees were killed by the Nazis when they were forced to return to Europe. Making sure that such a tragedy never happens again became the bedrock of U.S. and international refugee and asylum law and policy. Mr. Trump’s actions today upend this foundational principle and endanger millions all over the world.”</p>&mdash; Statement
